# Movie QA Frontend

This is a modern web frontend for the Movie Question Answering (QA) system based on ImDB 250. It allows users to ask questions about movies and get  answers from a backend API powered by SQL and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Features
- Clean, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS
- Background word cloud image for visual appeal
- Input box for natural language movie questions
- Displays answers from SQL queries or RAG (LLM) responses
- Loading animation and error handling
- Results shown in a styled table or prose format

## Usage
1. Place this `index.html` file in your web server or open it directly in your browser.
2. Set the `API_ENDPOINT` variable in the script section to your deployed REST API Gateway endpoint for the Lambda backend.
3. Ensure `movie_wordcloud.png` (generated by the backend or data pipeline) is present in the same directory for the background.

## Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Backend API endpoint (AWS Lambda via API Gateway, or compatible)
- `movie_wordcloud.png` in the same directory for background (optional, but recommended)

## Customization
- Update the `API_ENDPOINT` variable in the script to point to your backend.
- Adjust Tailwind or custom CSS for branding or layout changes.

## Security
- Do not expose sensitive API keys or credentials in the frontend code.
- Ensure CORS is enabled on your backend API for web access.
